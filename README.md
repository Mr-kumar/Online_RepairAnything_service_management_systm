Online Repair Management
Online Repair Management is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate the management of repair service requests. With three distinct user roles - User, Admin, and Technician, this platform provides a seamless experience for users to submit repair requests, for administrators to manage these requests, and for technicians to execute assigned repair tasks efficiently.

User Phase:
Users can easily submit repair requests for various appliances, electronics, plumbing, or any other repair needs. Here's how users can interact with the platform:




Submit Repair Requests: Users can submit detailed repair requests specifying their issues, contact information, and other relevant details.

Track Request Progress: Users can track the progress of their repair requests in real-time, from submission to completion.

Communicate with Technicians: Users can communicate with assigned technicians through built-in messaging features, providing updates or additional information as needed.








Admin Phase:
Administrators play a crucial role in managing repair requests and assigning tasks to technicians. Here's how administrators can manage the platform:

Manage Repair Requests: Administrators can view and manage incoming repair requests, assigning them to available technicians based on their expertise and availability.




Monitor Technician Activity: Administrators can monitor technician activity, track task progress, and ensure timely completion of repair requests.

Communication Hub: Administrators serve as a communication hub between users and technicians, facilitating effective communication and resolving any issues that may arise during the repair process.

Technician Phase:
Technicians are responsible for executing assigned repair tasks promptly and efficiently. Here's how technicians can utilize the platform:

View Assigned Tasks: Technicians can view their assigned repair tasks, including details about the issue, user contact information, and task deadlines.

Update Task Status: Technicians can update the status of repair tasks as they progress, providing real-time updates to users and administrators.

Communicate with Users: Technicians can communicate with users directly through the platform, addressing any concerns or providing additional information about the repair process.
